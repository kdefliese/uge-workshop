Git notes:

git add - adds file to staging area
think you have to do this again after you update a file?

git status - check status

git commit - will check changes into the master

git branch <name> - create a new branch
without a name, will tell you the branches you have

git checkout <existing branch name> - change to that branch

git remote -u origin <branchname> - initial upload

git push -u origin <branchname> - pushing a new branch
